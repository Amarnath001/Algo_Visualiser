# Visualization Components

This directory contains visualization components for different algorithm types.

## Structure

- `sorting/` - Components for sorting algorithm visualizations
- `searching/` - Components for searching algorithm visualizations  
- `graph/` - Components for graph algorithm visualizations
- `common/` - Shared visualization components

Each component should:
- Accept algorithm step data as props
- Render the current state visually
- Handle animations smoothly
- Be responsive and accessible
